#  Music Matcher

## Overview
MusicMatcher is a web application designed to connect users based on their music preferences. Through MusicMatcher, a Spotify user can find other Spotify listeners who like some of the same songs and artists. Once you have your matches, you can check out their Spotify profiles to see what else they listen to! If you want, you can even follow their profiles right from the MusicMatcher homepage.
